我們的 Logo 由兩個元素組成：三角形山脈及文字商標。在多數情況下， they should appear together as the opposite master lockup shows. The triangular mountains can be used on their own as an icon, profile picture or badge, but the wordmark should never be used without this symbol on the side.

Our brand typeface is DM Sans by Colophon Foundry for Google. This open-source typeface was chosen for its
combination of smoothness and structure. Its geometric shapes and soft transitions will bring clarity and openness
to our texts. Also, it’s open availability will let other members of the Nuxt community incorporate it into
their work.
